                        Meditation is a set of techniques that are intended to encourage a heightened state of awareness
                        and focused attention.
                        Meditation is also a consciousness technique that has been shown to have a wide number of
                        benefits on psychological well-being.

                            <h3>The Basics of Meditation</h3>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Focuses the Mind:
                                It is a common misconception that meditation causes the mind to become "quiet".
                                In reality, your mind is always thinking. Although your thoughts might not be as
                                rapid, it is perfectly nromal for your mind to be active when you are meditating. The
                                key is to acknowledge this with compassion while bringing the focus back to the breath
                                whenever you can. Meditation is like training a puppy to sit; the mind being the puppy,
                                and the breath being the trainer.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Being in the Now:
                                Rather than focusing on the past or the future, all meditative practices involve
                                focusing on
                                the present. Being in the now involves experiencing each moment, letting it go, and then
                                experiencing the next. Focusing on the here and now takes practice, as many of us live
                                most
                                of our lives thinking towards the future of ruminating on the past.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Altered State of Consciousness:
                                With time, maintaining a quiet mind and focusing on the present can lead to an altered
                                level of
                                consciousness that isn't asleeping state but isn't quite your average wakeful state
                                either. Meditation
                                increases brain acitivty in an area of the brain associated with happiness and positive
                                thoughts and
                                emotions, and some evidence shows that regular practice brings prolonged positive
                                changes in these areas.

                                Focused meditation requires you to focus your attention without being distracted by your
                                thoughts
                                You can focus on something visual, like a statue. Some focus their attention on
                                audiotory, like a
                                recording of ocean waves; something constant like your breathing or your heart beating.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Many people find it easier to do this than focus on nothing, but the concept is the same
                                - staying in
                                the present moment, circumventing the constant stream of commentart from your conscious
                                mind, and allowing
                                yourself to slip into an altered state of consciousness.

                                activities such as gardening, walking/hill walking,
                                going for hike, or even yoga. This type of meditation can quiet the mind while you are
                                "in the zone" experiencing the activity.

                                Mindfulnesss meditation similar to Activity Based Meditation, might not look like your
                                idea of meditation. Mindfulness simply involves staying in the present
                                rather than thinking about the future or the past. Again, this can be more difficult
                                than it seems. Focusing on sensations you feel in your body is one way to
                                stay "in the now". Focusing on emotions and where you feel them in your body - not
                                examining why you feel them, but just experiencing them as sensations - is another
                            </p>

                                Spiritual Meditation is not specific to any religion, it can be a spiritual practice.
                                You can meditate on a singular question until an answer comes, or meditate to clear your
                                mind and
                                accept whatever comes that day. Many people also practice kundalini meditation for
                                mind/body connection.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                At it's centre, spiritual meditation is the practice of a mindful connection to
                                something greater, than the individual.
                                This may seem paradoxical but the path to that connection passes through honest
                                self-reflection.

                                Breathing meditation is the most popular form of meditation because of its simplicity
                                and convenience, as we are always breathing.
                                The breath provides a natural focus that's unobstrusive, but always there. It also
                                creates a natural rhythm in case you get lost.
