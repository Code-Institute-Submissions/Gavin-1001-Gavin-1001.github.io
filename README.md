## General Introduction
With the current situtation with people working from home, many are unable to detatch from work stresses and their mental health takes affect. The idea behind this webpage? is to bring awareness about meditation for FINSIH

## User Experience
The target audience of this project is anyone who has an interest in Meditation or is looking to give Meditation a try. 

The target audience of Meditate of this project is anyone who has an interest in Meditation. The aim of Meditate is to bring interest to those who don't know a lot about meditation. For those who already have a good understanding of how we are affecting our oceans they should still be able to learn a little and understand what we are aiming to achieve with spreading knowledge.

Future Works
Futures works will include:
* Implementing a backend.
* Implement a feedback fourm for users.
* Implement a site map for ease of use.

## Design Brief
The main aim of Meditate is create a webpage that will (encourage[change word]) users to be more concious of they're mental health in the form of Meditation/Mindfulness. Another aim of the site is to provide simplistic, quick exercises for users to preform at home. For the basic design principle of the site was to keep it simplistic, easy to read information. The flow of the web site follows that trend of simplicity and calmness with it's colours and fonts. Below I have included my reasoning for choosing my font and colours for the project. 

Images: 
* All images that I used in the development of this project are from [Getty Images](https://www.gettyimages.ie/). This project is based off of the design of both wireframe 2 and wireframe 3. See


Colours:
The justification for my choice the colours below are inline with the overall design flow. I chose to stick to Blue / off Blue colours as these colors having a calming, and are proven to decrease the heart rate, lower blood pressure and reduce anxiety levels. I have included the colours below along with they're corresponding hex values.
* Background colour - #e9fcff
* Background colour of calender - #8c918f


Wireframe Diagrams:
Before beginning the project I created 3 wireframe diagrams using the wireframe software Balsamiq. Below are links to all wireframe diagrams that. 
* Desktop (Insert link here)
* Mobile (Insert link here)

Fonts:
The fonts that I chose are from the Google Fonts library. I chose to use Google Fonts as there is a better selection of fonts/ font styles compared to other libraries. Below I have included the fonts that were used in the project

* All heading tags - Mochiy Pop P One, sans-serif.
* All p tags - Quicksand, sans-serif.
